## Lecture Sections

Tuesday lectures will be conducted in-person by the instructor. Students may not join these lectures remotely, but the lecture recordings for the second section will be available to students in both sections. The synchronous lecture sections and details are:

| Section | Date/Time | Location | 
|:--------|:----------|:-------------|
| CS 272-01 Lecture | Tue 12:45-2:30p | Harney 136 |
| CS 272-02 Lecture | Tue 04:35-6:20p | Lo Schiavo G12 |
{: class="table is-hoverable" style="width: auto;" }

Students must attend their enrolled lecture section for exams, unless otherwise approved by the instructor. Room permitting, students may attend either lecture section on occasion on non-exam days.

Thursday lectures will be replaced with a mix of prerecorded videos, quizzes, and participation assignments. Students will also be able to meet 1:1 with the instructor during that time in person or via Zoom. Students should expect to meet 1:1 with the instructor for 10 to 20 minutes *every* week.

## Lab Sessions

Labs will be conducted in-person by the instructor during the first couple weeks of class. After that, the instructor will meet with students in 1:1 meetings while the teacher assistants provide homework and project help during the lab sessions. The lab sessions are:

| Section | Date/Time | Location |
|:--------|:----------|:-------------|
| CS 272L-01 Lab | Fri 2:15-3:20p | Lo Schiavo 307 |
| CS 272L-02 Lab | Fri 3:30-4:35p | Lo Schiavo 307 |
{: class="table is-hoverable" style="width: auto;" }

Students are encouraged to attend their enrolled lab session when possible, but may on occasion attend the other session if needed. Students must attend labs in-person to earn attendance credit; labs are not recorded or available via Zoom. 

Students may attend the 1:1 meetings with the instructor in-person or via Zoom.

## Office Hours

Office hours are dedicated times when the instructor and teacher assistants are available to meet exclusively with students to provide class help, as well as academic and professional advice. All students are strongly encouraged to take advantage of office hours---it is part of the university experience covered by tuition.

The instructor's office hours will be held in person in Harney 412B or via Zoom. See the pinned "Weekly Schedule" post on [Piazza]({{ site.data.info.links.forums.link }}) for the schedule and Zoom details.
