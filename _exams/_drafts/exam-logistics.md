This guide will discuss the logistics and possible topics for exam 1 and exam 2. See the [Retake Logistics](retake-logistics.html) for information on the exam retake.

## Format

The exam will be split into two components: (1) the primary exam conducted within Canvas and (2) a short coding section conducted using GitHub Classroom. To complete the exam, students must have access to:

| Resource | Login Account | Details |
|:-----------------|:--------------|:--------|
| [Canvas]({{ site.data.info.links.canvas.link }}) | Login using your USF account. | Used to conduct the exam. Will include the necessary GitHub Classroom link for the coding section. |
| [GitHub]({{ site.data.info.links.github.link }}) | Login using your GitHub account linked to this class. | Used for the coding section. A GitHub Classroom link will be provided in Canvas that will setup the necessary GitHub repository. Only code committed and pushed to this repository before the deadline will be used. |
| Eclipse | N/A | Used to import, run, commit, and push code for the coding section. Other IDEs may be used at the students' risk. Students should verify all of the relevant lecture code is runnable from within their IDE! |

The Canvas portion will *not* use Lockdown Browser. Students will *not* see your scores or answers after completing the exam until the retake begins.

## Modality

The exam will be locked with a password. How students will receive this password depends on their modality:

  - Students **attending remotely** must join the lecture Zoom livestream to receive the exam password at the start of lecture time. Students can ask questions about the exam privately in chat or using the "Raise Hand" feature on the Zoom. Students will be placed in a private breakout room for additional discussion if needed.

    While remote students have to join the lecture livestream at the start of the exam, students do not have to stay on the Zoom livestream while taking the exam. The Zoom livestream is there to provide immediate synchronous help, not monitor students.

  - Students **attending in person** will receive the exam password in class and do not need to join Zoom. Students can ask questions by raising their hand in class or approaching the lectern.

Any student may opt to choose a remote modality; pre-approval is not required.

## Timing

The exam will automatically unlock and lock at the start and end times of the enrolled section for each student. However, students may request a different start time by making a private post on [course forums]({{ site.data.info.links.forums.link }}).

The exam should take around 1 hour to complete, but students will have the entire class time of <i class="far fa-hourglass-half"></i> **1 hour 45 minutes** to complete the exam.

## Question Types

The exam questions on Canvas may consist of:

  - <span class="control"><label class="radio"><input type="radio" checked> Multiple Choice Questions</label></span>

  - <span class="control"><label class="checkbox"><input type="checkbox" checked> Multiple Answer Questions</label></span>

  - <span class="control"><span class="select"><select style="width: 300px;"><option>Dropdown Questions</option></select></span></span>

  - <span class="control"><input class="input" type="text" value="Fill in the Blank" style="width: 300px;" readonly></span>

The specific questions, order you see questions, and possible answers may be <i class="far fa-random"></i> randomized. These questions will be automatically graded by Canvas.

The exam code snippets will use the same infrastructure as homework: using GitHub Classroom links to setup private repositories with code templates and tests importable into Eclipse. The snippet grades will be automatically calculated by GitHub Classroom and GitHub Actions. Changes made to these repositories after the deadline will not impact the original exam score.

## Resources

The exams are open book, with the exception that students **cannot** ask anyone else (such as another current or former student) to answer a question on their behalf.

Students should make sure to have ready access to the following official Java documentation during the exam:

  - [Java API](https://www.cs.usfca.edu/~cs272/javadoc/api/index.html)
  - [Java SE Language Specification](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se17/html/index.html)
  - [Java SE Documentation Center](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/)
  - [Java Tutorials](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/)
  - [Java Glossary](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/information/glossary.html)

Students should also be prepared to access any of the class materials, including homework submissions. Students might also want to be familiar with `jshell` just in case they want to quickly run Java code.

## SDS Accommodations

Students may receive [exam accommodations](https://myusf.usfca.edu/sds/exam-accommodations), such as additional testing time, through [Student Disability Services](https://myusf.usfca.edu/sds/exam-accommodations). The instructor must receive a notification for accommodation from [SDS](https://myusf.usfca.edu/sds) approximately <strong>one week</strong> before the exam itself.

Contact the instructor on the [course forums]({{ site.data.info.links.forums.link }}) to schedule a specific time to take the exam and retake. In most cases, students will start the exam with their section and have additional time past the end of lecture time. The instructor will attempt to actively monitor the [course forums]({{ site.data.info.links.forums.link }}) for any exam questions after lecture time ends, but might not be available to answer questions live on Zoom.
